# Biography

I am Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Social Science at the Sheffield Methods Institute, The University of Sheffield. My research interests include public opinion, campaigns and elections, and intergroup relations. I also serve as the Director of the Sheffield Q-Step Centre, which is part of a Â£20 million investment from the Nuffield Foundation, Economic and Social Research Council, and Higher Education Funding Council for England to promote a step-change in quantitative social science training in the UK. My empirical research has been published in prestigious peer-reviewed academic journals such as the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Political Psychology*, *Political Communication*, *Political Behavior*, *Electoral Studies*, *The Journal of Quantitative Crimonology*, and *The Geographical Journal*.
